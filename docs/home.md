# Welcome to the GitIO wiki!

Here's the startup page of poorly documented software, because I don't feel like it makes sense to make it.

<br/>

Although people hates documentation in `README.md` so here we are.

<br/>

Above that main content, there's a navigation menu with type-specific stuff 
while on the left - contents of already opened file.

<br/>

Go to `Getting started` in order to start using GitIO for your workflow.
